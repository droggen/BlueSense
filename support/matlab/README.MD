Matlab demo/helper functions

- demo_plot_com_busyloop: reads data from BlueSense over a com port and plots it in real-time
- demo_read_com_busyloop: reads data from BlueSense over a com port and shows how to print it and compute some mathematical functions on the data
- demo_plot_bt_busyloop_bin: read data from Bluesense over bluetooth and plots in real-time. Suitable for the "fast adc" mode where one channel is transmitted in 8-bit binary (each byte is a sample).
- demo_plot_com_busyloop_bin: read data from Bluesense over a com port and plots in real-time. Suitable for the "fast adc" mode where one channel is transmitted in 8-bit binary (each byte is a sample).
