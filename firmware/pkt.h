/*
   This file provides helper functions to create packets for streaming data transfer.
   In particular it provides functions to append data into a packet. Data can be of
   various sizes, including custom-sized bitfields.
   Checksumming is also supported.

   Usage:
      1. Declare a packet once (e.g. as a global variable)
      2. Before filling the packet, call packet_init
      3. Fill the packet with the various packet_add??? functions
	  	4a.If not adding a checksum, call packet_end to complete the bit aligment in the last data byte
      4b.Otherwise append a checksum with packet_checksum_*** functions which will complete the bit alignment and add teh checksum
      5. Stream the packet. The size of the packet in bytes is provided by packet_size.
