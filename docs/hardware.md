Hardware characteristics




ATmega1284P core (128KB flash, 16KB RAM)
30x30mm
USB interface for charging, device interaction
Bluetooth interface for device interaction
SD card (SDHC standard)
Most accurate RTC (real-time clock) on the market: +/-5ppm
9DoF motion sensor (MPU9250) including software attitude and heading reference system at 100Hz (quaternion output). The system is capable of acquiring and storing raw motion data at 1KHz, which is useful for high frequency applications (sports, vibration analysis)
Extension ports with analog inputs, digital I/O, I2C, SPI, timekeeping, etc.
Coulomb counter allowing precise measurement of battery charge/discharge and characterisation of real-time current consumption by software
