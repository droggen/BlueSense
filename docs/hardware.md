### Hardware characteristics


* ATmega1284P core (128KB flash, 16KB RAM)
* 30x30mm
* 9DoF motion sensor (MPU9250) including software attitude and heading reference system at 100Hz (quaternion output). The system is capable of acquiring and storing raw motion data at 1KHz, which is useful for high frequency applications (sports, vibration analysis)
* USB interface for charging, device interaction
* Bluetooth interface for device interaction
* SD card (SDHC standard)
* Most accurate RTC (real-time clock) on the market: +/-5ppm
* Coulomb counter allowing precise measurement of battery charge/discharge and characterisation of real-time current consumption by software
* Extension ports with analog inputs, digital I/O, I2C, SPI, timekeeping, etc.
